      <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/hw.jpg" alt="Your Name">

      <p id="p">Originally from Miami, Florida and still fairly new to Austin. I gaduated with a communications degree from the University of Central Florida but have worked in the hopspitality industry for the majority of the last ten years. Very new to coding, and to be honest, it scares the shit out of me. I've never thought of myself as a technical person, but I've been looking for a major career change and all the dollar signs point to coding. More than just the financial stability I hope to gain, I also want a career that continues to challenge me and that offers flexibility when it comes to location. I'd love to move to Denver in a few year and have even toyed with the idea of moving out of the country. This is all very new, very challenging, and extremely terrifying.
